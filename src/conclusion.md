And that's it for this tutorial, I hope it helped you get more familiar with Iced. :)

[Iced's discord](https://discord.gg/3xZJ65GAhd) is a place where you can ask quick questions.
[Their discourse](https://discourse.iced.rs/) is a place where you can have longer discussions and is where the developers spend more time.

The docs are also quite good. Iced is split in a number of crates, check especially iced and iced_native:
- [https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/)
- [https://docs.rs/iced_native/latest/iced_native/](https://docs.rs/iced_native/latest/iced_native/)

And of course, the github issues:
