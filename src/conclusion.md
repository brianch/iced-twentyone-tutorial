# Conclusion

And that's it for this tutorial, I hope it helped you get more familiar with Iced. :)

<br>

[Iced's discord](https://discord.gg/3xZJ65GAhd) is a great place to ask for help if you have questions about the library.

The docs are also quite good. Iced is split in a number of crates, check especially iced and iced_native:
- [https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/)
- [https://docs.rs/iced_native/latest/iced_native/](https://docs.rs/iced_native/latest/iced_native/)

And of course, the github issues:

[https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues)
