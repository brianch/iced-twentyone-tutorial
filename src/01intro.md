# Introduction

In this tutorial we will go from the most basic hello world and, step by step, create a 1-player twenty-one kind of game in iced, it'll be very simple, not even with a betting function, but by the end you'll be ready to implement it yourself ;)

To make your life easier, it's nice to use an IDE with autocompletion, VS Code with the rust-analyser plugin is a good option.

I'll cheat on the game logic by providing the data structures ready, since this isn't iced related.

### Disclaimer:
I'm neither an iced contributor nor an experienced Rust developer, I'm writing this based on my experience using iced and on the info I've seen on iced's docs, github and discord.

Anyway, I hope this can be useful somehow.
